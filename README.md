# Sly-Schedule

User Prompt:
- As an person with a busy schedule, I would like an online planner to schedule important events so that I can manage my time effectively.

Website Task:
- Whenever a user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, and below it they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9AM-5PM).
- As the day goes on, the Sly-Schedule will color code each time block to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- The time blocks are clickable and the user's daily plans can be entered as an event within the text area.

Update(s) Coming Soon:
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
